# weather-dashboard
An application  that allows users to check the current weather of any US city, including a 5 day forecast.

## What I Did
I built an application that uses server side APIS and CDNS to fetch weather data and then display it to the user in a nice layout for the current day and the next 5 days.
The user can type in a city, click search and view the city's current weather, date, an icon temp, humidity, UV index, and windspeed. 
The city is saved into a search history section and can be clicked upon even after refreshing the browser to provide that city's current and future conditions.

## What I Learned
Building this application I learned how important it is to always do your layouts first. I also learned how to use both javascript and jquery in order to accomplish 
my code to be able to function preoperly. 

### Demo

**Below is a short demo of how my application works.
